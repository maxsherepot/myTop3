                    <p>
                        Our team of engineers, designers and riders spent years creating a new bike that met all high standards, but the wait was worth it. The revival of this bike marks a huge step forward, offering a real advantage in the high-speed passage of tracks. It all starts with a fully composite frame equipped with the most modern Maestro suspension.</p>
                    <p>
                        The advanced forged composite rocker arm and shock absorber on the axle help to ensure a smooth ride of the rear wheels by 115 mm, which is active and sensitive to small shocks, providing excellent traction and confident control. And the frame geometry is completely new, with progressive tilt angles for the seat post and seat, shorter chains and a longer tube - all designed to balance the speed and control of the 29-inch wheels with the speed and maneuverability needed to cut corners, punch trails and do it all with confidence and control.</p>

                        It is optimized for larger diameter wheels with the updated Maestro suspension system, which is tuned to a stiffer rear triangle. Geometry makes it faster and more maneuverable on ascents and descents. The shock mount on the trunnion provides a smooth, flexible feel with improved pedaling performance. The improved forged composite upper beam is lighter and stronger than the previous aluminum version. The increased distance between the Boost hubs increases wheel stiffness for better control on rough terrain.</p>
